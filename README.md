Python cmd youtube downloader

This script lets you either search terms from the commandline as though you are searching at the youtube search input field or search for items on youtube one by one as read line by line from a file.

When you press enter, a list of search results is returned
From this list, you select the item you wish to download
The script checks for resolutions in the order 480p,720p and finally 360p. The resolution found first is downloaded. If none of them is found, the script fails to download the file.

You can change the order of these resolutions or add new resolutions according to your requirements.

Note: The script requires pytube and bs4 modules which do not come packaged with the standard python installation.

Enjoy commandline downloading
